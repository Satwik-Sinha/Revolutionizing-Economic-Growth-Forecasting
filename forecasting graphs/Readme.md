The project generates 10 graphs, each representing different aspects of the UDE training and forecasting process:
UDE Forecasting Graphs
Case 1: Train till t = 9.0, Forecast till t = 10.0
Shows training prediction up to t = 9.0 and forecasting from t = 9.0 to t = 10.0.
Case 2: Train till t = 7.0, Forecast till t = 10.0
Displays training prediction up to t = 7.0 and forecasting from t = 7.0 to t = 10.0.
Case 3: Train till t = 5.0, Forecast till t = 10.0
Illustrates training up to t = 5.0 and forecasting from t = 5.0 to t = 10.0.
Case 4: Train till t = 3.0, Forecast till t = 10.0
Presents training prediction until t = 3.0 and forecasting from t = 3.0 to t = 10.0.
Case 5: Train till t = 1.0, Forecast till t = 10.0
Demonstrates training up to t = 1.0 and forecasting from t = 1.0 to t = 10.0.

Each graph  includes:
The underlying data
The training prediction line
The forecasting prediction line
Appropriate labels for axes (Time on x-axis, Capital per effective worker on y-axis)
A legend distinguishing between underlying data, training prediction, and forecasting prediction
A title indicating the specific case and training/forecasting time spans
